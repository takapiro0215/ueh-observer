## Overview
UEH Observer is a read-only observer infrastructure designed to visualize DeFi risk boundaries and on-chain state with verifiable accuracy.

This system does NOT:
- Execute transactions
- Provide financial advice
- Optimize positions
- Act as a trading bot

It only exposes state, boundaries, and trust metadata.

## Core Philosophy
- Boundary over prediction
- Refusal over uncertainty
- Observability over automation
- Survivability over convenience

## Key Features (MVP)
- High-precision board-style CLI output
- Trust & Accuracy metadata (block, lag, source)
- Refusal-based reliability model
- Non-custodial read-only architecture

## Status
Early-stage infrastructure specification (Observer Layer of UEH)
